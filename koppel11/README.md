## koppel11 - An Approach to Authorship Attribution

This is a reimplementation of the approach to authorship attribution originally described in

[Authorship attribution in the wild](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Moshe_Koppel/publication/220147732_Authorship_attribution_in_the_wild/links/0deec52fd3fd6b60b3000000.pdf).

It was reimplemented as part of a science reproducibility study alongside [14 other authorship attribution approaches](https://github.com/search?q="Who+wrote+the+web"+user:pan-webis-de). The results of the reproducibility study can be found in

## Usage

To execute the software, install it and make sure all its dependencies are installed as well; then run the software using the following command:

`python koppel11.py <path-to-input-data> <output-path>`

## Input and Output Formats

The software accepts authorship attribution datasets that are formatted according to the corresponding [PAN shared task on authorship attribution](http://pan.webis.de/tasks.html). A number of [datasets can be found there](http://pan.webis.de/data.html), and all of them are formatted as follows.

In a dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY`, a `meta-file.json` is found which comprises

  - the language of the texts within (e.g., EN, GR, etc.),
  - the names of the subdirectories that contain texts from candidate authors,
  - the name of the subdirectory that contains texts of unknown authorship, and
  - the name of each file of unknown authorship that is to be attributed to one of the candidate authors.
  
The software accepts as input a path to an inflated dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY` and starts the authorship attribution process from there. The output in the `OUTPUT_PATH` will be a file `answers.json` formatted as follows:

```json
{
"answers": [
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00001.txt", "author": "candidate00001", "score": 0.8},
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00002.txt", "author": "candidate00002", "score": 0.9}
	]
}
```

where `unknown_text` is the name of an unknown text as per `meta-file.json`, `author` is the name of a candidate author as per `meta-file.json`, and `score` is as real value in the range [0,1] which indicates the software's confidence in its attribution (0 means completely uncertain, 1 means completely sure).
