The last few words on the page burned like fever. The sculptor read
them again and again until they blurred into insensibility. He let the
book fall to the floor, and left it where it fell, the soft flapping of closing
pages like a balm to his mind, the sudden loss of stimulus a cold compress
over his hot eyes. He rubbed them until he saw stars and spoke
those last few words out loud. In doing so, he not only confirmed to himself
that it could be done, he knew instantly the way to do it.
It would not be enough to build the thing of clay alone. He knew that.
He had read the lore, of course, had in fact taken much of it with a pinch
of salt, but much had touched something in him, something that bypassed
his blinding grief. It had to do with hope and belief. It had to do
with the fact that so much truth was hidden within the myth, so much
that had to be true. It was this he clung to, a raft hopelessly battered
upon a sea of nonsense. And then he had found the book. Called simply
Earth, Risen it was written anonymously in flowing script onto dark
parchment-like paper, in a mixture of Hebrew and English. It was this
book that had finally convinced him that it could be done.
Are you sure you want to know? the bookseller had asked him. There are
some things a man should not be party to, and I believe with all my heart that
this is one of them.
But the bookseller was as driven by money as anyone else, and he had
accepted the payment graciously, holding the sculptor's gaze for perhaps
longer than necessary. And so the book had been bought and devoured
in the way important books so often are. The book had such a simplicity
to it that he knew at once it was genuine. So much of the lore he had
studied had been hyperbole, covering up lies and misrepresented fact
with drama and shocking revelation. Not so this book. It was, in
essence, an instruction manual, a description of the how and why of it.
He bent now to retrieve the slim volume, and turned immediately to the
last page.
   and so with truth, and with their own vitality, or substantial part of it,
they will live. And when truth dies, as it eventually must, it will be the end of
them, and they cannot revive  '
And then that last line, as with the bookseller, holding his gaze just
that little bit longer than he would have liked.
   be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined
which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth  '
The sculptor stood and the candles set all about him danced as he
moved. A soft wind blew about his feet, sending dust motes into frenzied
choreography. He poured a large glass of wine, took half of it in
one swallow, and set the glass down on a long low bench that flanked
one side of the room. In the centre of the room lay a table, high and
sturdy. Next to this was a box, an old tea chest, rough hewn planks making
up its walls, a hinged lid open to the floor. He reached into the chest,
grabbed the neck of the sack within and hefted the load onto the table. A
muted clunk broke the silence, and pale dust sifted through the open
weave of the sacking. He opened the sack and one by one, lifted out the
contents, arranging them roughly, discarding the sack when he was
done.
The assortment of bones on the table sent a cold shiver through him.
They were small and dull and off-white. Dried sinew and tiny shreds of
black flesh clung to some of the larger ones; the femur and skull, a
shoulder blade. He had bagged hand and foot bones so as to keep them
together, and released them now in a clattering pile like druids' rune
stones, beginning to arrange the tableau as if it were nothing more than a
jigsaw puzzle. He had once studied anatomy and bone structure and
human physiology for his sculptures. It was this knowledge he used
now to reassemble the skeleton. Some bones were missing  , a rib here,
vertebra there, lower jaw hopelessly crushed when his shovel had
broken through the rotted coffin lid  , but it was only a matter of hours
before he had something on his table that he recognised.
It was an almost complete child's skeleton.
He took a battery-powered drill and fitted the smallest bit he could find.
It looked no thicker than a toothpick. With whining monotony, sending
tiny puffs of foul smelling blue smoke into the air, he set about drilling
holes into the ends of each and every bone. He was fastidious, clamping
each in steady fingers, blowing gently to send the smoke spiralling away
from his eyes. A faint burning smell began to surround him, and he
worked on. The bones in the feet were drilled now, and he moved onto
the hand, and vertebrae. He used a slightly larger bit to drill the leg and
arm bones, and the complex machinery of shoulder blade and ribs and
collar bone. The rib cage was almost completely intact, apart from the
missing rib, and he set this down on the floor as he worked. As each
hour passed, tiny drifts of browning bone dust appeared at the ends of
each cluster of bones.
His excitement grew as each bone was holed, and he began to relish
the sweet burning aroma as drill met bone. The sound became the
soundtrack to his work, and when he had finished, the last vertebra
drilled and placed back with its brothers, he stood back from the table,
unaware that the drill was whining redundantly in his hand. He stayed
that way, eyes scanning the skeleton over and over to spot any missed
bones, until the battery died and the drill fell silent. He dropped it and
kicked it absently away from him.
From under the bench, in between sips of steadying wine, he sorted
through a jumble of boxes and settled on two. The first contained wire.
Yards and yards of hair thin silver wire, wrapped fastidiously with
strands of spider silk, so that they shimmered like dull moonlight. It had
taken months of painstaking and ultimately painful work to collect the
silk from his battery of captive spiders. It had to be spider silk. This was
one piece of lore that he truly believed, and the book was specific about
it.
The second contained a lump of wet clay about the size of a football. It
was this he brought to the table now, along with a book detailing human
anatomy. His skilled fingers worked quickly to separate a piece of clay
and draw it into a rough cylinder, about an inch thick and eight long.
With it, in between long consultations with the diagrams in his anatomy
book, he fashioned a rough flattened semi circle. He drew each end into
a paddle about twice the width of the rest. He moulded the whole into a
rounded V, and set it next to the skull for sizing. With further modifications
and trimming of excess clay, he fitted the piece exactly to the skull.
He had made a jawbone.
Satisfied, he removed more clay from its box and set about creating a
rib, the missing vertebra. Soon, for he was an accomplished sculptor, he
was satisfied. He removed the clay pieces carefully, and walked with
them over to his kiln in the far corner. His hands were stained with the
clay, calloused and sore from hours of painstaking drilling. He placed
the pieces into the kiln, watching for a moment as the haze of fire
shimmered around them. The smell of hot clay surrounded him. He
washed his hands, and changed clothes, throwing the clay-streaked shirt
and jeans into an uncomfortable heap next to the kiln. He allowed himself
a short sleep.
Hours later, the pieces fired and cooled, he sanded their jagged edges
and drilled their ends. They fitted into place perfectly, as he knew they
would, and a short frisson of excitement ran through him.
The skeleton was complete.
He began to thread the silk-wrapped silver wire through each and
every holed bone. He snipped each piece to size and loosely twisted
their ends together. The purpose of the wire was not for strength. It was
not to hold the skeleton together, although he hoped the silk wrapped
wire could bear the skeleton's weight for a short time. Rather it was a
symbol of completion; a tying together of spirit and bone, locking the
loose pieces so that they might know they belong together, and behave
accordingly. As sweat ran through the mask of dried clay on his face, his
tears joined it, tiny tributaries swelling like a river in a cracked river bed.
He wiped the moisture away, smearing the clay like claw marks under
his eyes and across his cheeks, red ochre where his finger tips had
cracked and added their own moisture.
When the final wires between skull and clay jawbone were secured, he
moved a second table into place alongside the first. On this he slapped
down great chunks of wet clay, relishing the earthy smell, the living
quality of the mineral. Fresh spatters of brown water coated him. He
fashioned a rough silhouette of a human body, arms and legs and torso
about three times their natural width. He pressed a large disc into place
where the head should be. He offered up a silent prayer and slipped his
hands under the skeleton, one at the knees and the other under the fragile
puzzle of vertebrae below the skull. He hefted the wired bones off
the table, and had a moments panic when the head lolled comically backwards
and the legs clattered towards the floor. The wires held, however,
and, its feet kicking in the air, he transferred the skeleton to the second
table, laying it lovingly onto the clay silhouette, as a father might lay a
sleeping child into bed.
Next he filled a large bucket with water and set it next to the skeleton.
Immersing his hands in the blessedly cool water, he let them sit there for
a while, absently rubbing fingertip against fingertip, scrubbing the blood
and grime away.
OK, he said softly, and the words echoed around the dusty room.
He removed his hands from the bucket and, still dripping, set them
about their work bringing the soft clay silhouette up and around the collection
of bones. The hollows in the rib cage and between leg and arm
bones, he filled with rough blocks of clay. Hours he spent kneading and
moulding and knitting edges, filling gaps, adding here, taking away
there. He gently turned the body over, and began to work on the back,
cleverly shaping the muscles in the back and neck, rounding the clay at
the back of the skull, remembering the tiny flat spot just above the nape
that he loved. Turning again, he set the body down, heavy now, its heft
just right, the still wet clay falling as it should, legs turning slightly out,
hands resting palm up. He worked on them now, separating fingers,
moulding knuckles and joints, carving delicate lines and creases. Toe and
fingernails were shaped, the minute curls of excess clay from his knife
falling around his feet. The body he roughed into shape, content to have
the idea of it just right, but the detail he forewent in favour of the tiny
outfit of clothes hanging from the door. These he would dress the body
in once dry.
At last he could do no more, and sat back heavily, the table and its
body lying at face height. He gasped at its likeness, despite the blank
face. He ran a hand across its chest, cupped the narrow chin, and with a
fingernail, described a rough mouth, and position of the eyes. He teased
a rough pyramid of clay from the middle of the face and shaped absently
into its nose. He could do no more and fell back, exhausted. From his
jeans pocket he drew a picture. Its edges were torn and crumpled but
the face staring from it was crisp and clear.
His boy.
He slept where he had fallen, the clay on his hands drying to pale
ochre dust, the body above him hardening slightly in the dry air. He
dreamt no dreams save for the face of the boy, and the sound of
screaming.
It seemed when he woke that he had been gripped by fever anew. He
rose and almost instantly started his work, as early morning arrived
without acknowledgement. With an array of shaping and cutting tools,
he set about the body's face. With memory alone he teased and shaped
and moulded. The nose that he had roughed out the night before became
exact, the small bump on its bridge so lifelike he bent to kiss it as
he had so many years before. He worked tirelessly, cupping the shape of
cheeks with his moistened palms, creating tiny flaps of clay that he
pressed into place over eyes that stared into his with uncanny reason.
He went as far as to scratch tiny lines at the corner of the eyes, extracting
signs of life almost absently. The tiny full mouth; pointed chin with its
smooth dimple; high, full forehead. All these features became reality in
his hands. With strands of clay rolled into straw thicknesses, he began
layering the dome of skull with hair, each layer subjected to a barber's
scrutiny to ensure that the strands lay just right. He created the flick of
fringe that half covered one eye, and turning the body carefully, let the
longer strands at the back just reach to the body's shoulders. He looked
at the face, and with a calculated flick, opened the mouth like a wound;
remoulded the lips and added the impression of teeth within. Stepping
back from the visage, he let out a coughing cry, hands covering the lower
half of his own face, muting his shock. He reached to remould the ear
lobes, but let the knife fall, content.
It was perfect.
His son lay on the table before him, androgynous from the neck down,
but utterly right and beautiful above. The sculptor spoke his name over
and over, and his sobbing words grew slowly quieter, and night fell once
more.
As the sun burned away a ground mist, and a sweet smelling breeze
blew in through the recently opened door, he dressed the figure quickly,
allowing the soft folds of cloth to mask any imperfections in the moulding
of the body. He had slept well, and changed into clean jeans and a
shirt. He rescued the book from the floor and smoothed the pages.
Almost subliminal in their placing, the symbols he had searched for
were in the middle of the book, scratched with faded ink into one margin;
one truth, one death. To mark his son with the first would bring
life. The second would end it. He had practiced their curling form over
and over, until he could draw them in his sleep.
He swallowed the dregs of his third coffee that morning and held his
shaking hands up to his face. With a huge effort, he willed them to calm,
and they did. The father became the sculptor then, all thoughts erased
except for that of rendering the symbols perfectly. He turned once more
to his clay son, smoothed the hair as if it were living, feeling and hearing
the soft rasp of dry clay under his fingertips. It wasn't until he saw the
first drop of moisture on the face, sinking like rain on a cracked river
bed, that he realised he was crying.
He selected a knife from his tools, and laid an elbow next to the face,
cupping the hand holding the knife with his other. He breathed deeply
and held it. When all sound had ceased, when all he could sense was the
slight pressure and throb of blood in his ears, he lowered the knife to the
forehead and watched, as if he were a mere observer, as the tip scratched
into the clay.
?O?
Truth.
The symbols came easily. Indeed, they seemed to form themselves,
the knife cutting into the clay like it was fresh and soft. Tiny parings
muddied the edges, and he blew on these absently. It was done. The
last thing was to feed them. His blood was the only choice, obviously,
and so he used the same knife, heedless to the clay-soiled tip, to part his
skin on the tip of his thumb. Seconds passed until blood welled into the
cut, spilling silently. His mind still blank other than thought of his task,
he pressed the wound onto the symbol on his son's forehead. He felt
pain then, almost a sucking sensation as the dry clay eagerly sought his
fluids.
It happened very quickly. A slight hum filled his ears, the sound of
electricity perhaps, and he felt a thrumming under his hand, still pressed
to his son. He lifted his hand quickly, and stepped back from the body,
rigidly upright, eyes wide with shock. He had known it would work,
prayed for it, and yet now he was chilled to the bone with fear. A finger
curled. The cloth of the figure's clothes shifted and settled. The sculptor
moved nearer, clutching the knife tightly, breath rasping faster and
faster, nostrils flared. An eye opened, the sound like one stone scratching
across another. Another eye. The perfectly rendered eyes, complete
except for colour (why hadn't he thought to add colour?), turned and
moved and rolled in their sockets. They found him suddenly, fixed on
him, blinked slowly, and stared.
The sculptor let out a cry, fell to his knees, and moaned his son's
name. The body sat up on the table, dried clay falling from it like leaves,
as if they had been playing in an autumn garden. The mouth opened,
and impossibly, almost silent, but not silent, it breathed. It reached to
him, flexing its fingers, working them like it was trying on new gloves.
It smacked its lips silently, discovering the configurations of its face,
learning movement and sound and form, even as it shifted its bulk to the
edge of the table. A further icicle of fear pierced the sculptor's spine as
the boy raised one hand and made a fist. Slowly, exerting utmost control,
it extended one finger and pointed to him.
daddy?
came a scratching question. The body shifted nearer the edge of the
table, until gravity took hold. With no knowledge of balance or of the
mechanisms needed to stand, the body pitched helplessly onto the floor
and lay; a soft mewling sound broke the stillness.
The sculptor moved quickly to its side, all fear gone. He moaned the
boy's name over and over, convinced he would find the body hopelessly
broken. But whatever magic had brought tragic life to his sculpture, it
seemed also to have brought a physical sturdiness, for even as he
reached the body, it was pushing itself into a sitting position, limbs and
face and body intact.
daddy
it said again, confident this time, its voice still no more than a scraping
whisper. The sculptor reached his hands to cup the boy's cheeks, chilled
anew at the pulsing warmth beneath the clay. He pushed the fear aside,
closed his eyes and bent to plant a kiss on the boy's forehead. If he had
expected the kiss to land on soft, pliant skin, perfumed with fresh air and
the exertion of play, then the reality could not have come as more of a
shock. Gritty powder coated his lips, and he tasted the alkalinity of clay,
the earthiness of the boy's flesh. He moaned again.
The boy moaned with him, a helpless
wa wa wa wa wa
and the sculptor ran his hands across the waving hair, so lifelike to
touch, but smelling like the earth it was. He kissed him again, this time
knowing the feeling and so relishing it. His son, born again.
As he drew closer, folded his arms about the boy, the sounds he was
issuing suddenly became clearer.
wa wa w   .w  wh  wh
why?
why?
why?
why?
why?
The sculptor sat back, unable to think as the boy repeated his desperate
question again and again. In all his planning, years and years of searching,
never had he thought that this would be the first question the boy
would ask. Tears streamed down his face, and as he reached out, the
boy backed off, shedding dust and clay particles as he went, backing up,
backing up until he reached a wall. He continued to push with his legs
and in doing so, learned the mechanism of standing. The sculptor stood
with him, and moved to stand in front of him, imploring the boy with
eyes and gestures and words, to come to him, to let himself be held and
to be a son again. The boy's eyes flickered around the room, landing on
the sculptor's face, the table, the chairs, the window, the open door, the
open door
the open door
the open door
Before the sculptor could gather his wits, before he had chance to
move, the boy pushed roughly past him, knocking him aside, and
crashed through the open door, morning sunlight highlighting the contours
of his exquisite face. The sculptor let out a shout of fear and confusion,
but ultimately he was too late. The boy had gone.
Time passed of which the sculptor had no recollection. The air seemed
muted and grey, sounds muffled. Indeed solace could only be found in
darkness and in such a state of drunkenness that he felt nothing but the
burn of cheap wine. Even the hollow pain in his chest seemed diminished.
For a time after his creation had fled, he had raged, hurling tools
and lumps of sodden clay about the room, erasing any sign of his work,
erasing any sign of the loss he had faced twice now. His son. His poor
son. Panic fluttered constantly at the edge of his mind, his hands shook,
and sounds issued from his ragged throat that bore no resemblance to
human noises.
What have I done? he cried to the room. My son!
He began to piece together anything that might help him find the boy.
He read and re-read Earth, Risen, hoping, desperately searching for some
nugget he had missed. Where might he have gone? Who may have
found him? And all this was affording the sculpture sentient thought.
What if it was mindless, nothing more than animated clay? What if there
was none of his son left? But the first word from its mouth had been
daddy. Surely it must be his son. It must be. He took a drink of wine
then, and one followed, and followed. Bottle after bottle was consumed,
and the sculptor began to dream that none of it had happened. Darkness
turned darker, sound failed him, and he lost his fight with sleep. But
even sleep could not protect him from images of moving clay, great
lumpen faces with stretched maws, grasping hands, tearing, pulling.
And always the questions.
why why why why why why why why why?
He woke screaming.
    be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined
which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth  '
Was it love he wanted, truly? Or was he really seeking the boy's
wrath? He closed his eyes and saw the boy's face, heard screaming,
heard the breaking of glass and shrieking of tyres. He lived the moment
that his son died, over and over.
Died because of him.
Because he took the boy from his mother in a drunken rage, drove in a
drunken rage, killed his son in a drunken rage.
He read the words again. In a second he knew. Knew everything. He
knew somewhere in the back of his mind that he could never have lived
with the sculpture like he would have his own son. And so love was not
his aim here. That left only wrath, and as soon as he thought it, he felt a
great weight lift. At last he felt the burden of his son's death lift from his
shoulders, and he knew where to find him.
The door stood open still, flecks of clay marring the surface. It was a
short walk to the bridge. The place where he had driven from the road,
plunged the car into the icy river. To this day, he could not have said it
was truly an accident or truly deliberate. But it happened, and as the
black water flooded the car, and he struggled with his own seatbelt, he
heard his son screaming and screaming. Until water smothered them
both. He lived. His son did not, and now as he approached the small
bridge, the replacement railing that his car had destroyed still a shade
lighter than the original all these years on, he saw the figure sitting on
the wooden boards. It had lost its clothes, and he saw again how
unfinished its body was. A mere suggestion of form, and yet hands as
perfect as in life covered a face that he knew better than his own. It
sobbed as it sat there, whispers of pain and sadness reaching the
sculptor's ears. He bent to it and rested a hand on its shoulders. It reacted
violently, snatching itself away, its mouth open in a silent scream,
a suggestion of fear in its eyes. It locked gaze with him, and in a heart
lifting moment, its mouth curled in a smile. Faint and stiff as the clay
had dried but it was there.
daddy
it said.
my son, he replied holding his arms out wide. It came to him then, and
wrapped its arms around him. He sobbed and sobbed, tears dappling
the dome of its head, running along the cleft of its parted hair. He
dropped to his knees, knowing what was to come, and yet feeling nothing
but the joy of finding his boy. He smiled and kissed the face lightly.
He picked the boy up, rested his weight on the railings above the roiling
water. It was as black as he remembered. Reaching a hand up to the
creature's forehead, he whispered two words onto its tiny ear.
i'm sorry
Its grip on him tightened and its eyes widened slightly as it realised
somehow what he was about to do. He rested a thumb on its forehead,
and with a scratching stroke, scraped out the first symbol drawn there.
He remembered the text from Earth, Risen, remembered the symbols perfectly.
In scratching out that first, he effectively turned truth,
into death,
The transformation happened quickly. Suddenly the sculpture was
just that. In its eyes, there was nothing. He looked down into its face
and saw not life there, but only the numerous faint marks of the tools
that he had used to render it. The body was a dead weight, and its arms
a hardened clay sculpture around his middle. As it dropped and he had
neither the strength nor the desire to stop its fall, it took him with it.
The water hit him with a slap of iciness, and he didn't hesitate to finish
what he had started. His first breath was air and foamy water and he
coughed it out reflexively. His next, and the next, and the next, were not
air. It was black freezing water he was filling his lungs with now, and he
welcomed it. His son would have breathed the same water, would have
felt the same panic, the pain in his chest that was fading remarkably
quickly now he had resigned to it. As darkness came over him, he felt
the clay sculpture begin to disintegrate in his hands. Faintly he felt the
scrape of its hands as it released him into the water, and he reached with
the last of his strength and wit to catch hold of its face. Clay crumbled
under his touch, and he brought his hand back and kissed the residues.
The action of the water gave the face a lopsided grin, one he remembered
so well, and his tears added infinitesimal volume to the raging river.
The pain was gone. His sight and hearing were gone. There was no
feeling as the current tore him this way and that, scraped his trailing legs
along the river bed, tore into his flesh with loose rock and branch. There
was just the feeling of floating and the heart-bursting joy as a small hand
took his and a whisper of love from a small voice echoed in his ear. He
was content to lose his life for this; as if he had sculpted love from the
very bones of despair and guilt.
To have that hand in his, and those whispers of love and forgiveness
in his ear.
To have those, without life?
It was enough.
